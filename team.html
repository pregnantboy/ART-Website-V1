                        </h3>
                        <p>An engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset, Alex co-founded Asia Risk Transfer Solutions (ARTS) in 2016 after completing his studies at Nanyang Technological University’s flagship Renaissance Engineering Programme. He won numerous academic accolades and was successful at prominent student competitions and hackathons, most notably winning the 2015 Global Shell Innovation Competition (Shell Ideas360) held in the Netherlands.
                        <br/><br/>
                        During his college years, Alex deepened his interest and understanding in the area of Catastrophe Risk Management, underlined with research experience at ICRM-NTU (Singapore) and an internship stint at RMS (California). It is at RMS that he first met Prof. Haresh Shah, co-founder of ARTS. Their collaborations and work in the domain thereafter uncovered the technological possibilities, market potential and societal need for Insurance for the Masses, which culminated in the formation of ARTS.
                        <br/><br/>
                        With ARTS, Alex sets his sights on building a purposeful business as an agent of change and a force for good — bringing financial and risk transfer innovations to the people who need them most.</p>

                        <p> A pioneer in the fields of risk analysis, earthquake engineering, and probabilistic methods, Haresh Shah is the Obayashi Professor of Engineering, Emeritus, at Stanford University, Founder and Senior Advisor of Risk Management Solutions, and Emeritus Member of the Board of Trustees at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Professor Shah has been the recipient of many honors throughout his career, including EERI's George W. Housner and Alfred E. Alquist Special Recognition Medals for his extraordinary and lasting contributions to earthquake safety worldwide, as well as International Insurance Society’s John S. Bickley Gold Medal for his sustained and outstanding contributions to the insurance industry. Most recently in 2015, in recognition of his exceptional and outstanding contributions to the academic development of Nanyang Technological University, Professor Shah was conferred an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree awarded personally from the President of the Republic of Singapore, Tony Tan Keng Yam.
                        <br/><br/>
                        As an industry veteran with over 35 years of experience, Professor Shah considers risk protection of the masses as one of the most unmet needs of our world today. Such needs underpin the motivations for the formation of Asia Risk Transfer Solutions (ARTS). Professor Shah takes a personal interest in overseeing the strategic development of inclusive risk protection for the masses with ARTS.</p>

                        <p>Geologist, artist and analyst, Ernest is an explorer of knowledge and has a simple outlook towards life with a deep appreciation for philosophy.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Ernest had always shown a keen interest in the scientific fields and the universe around him. This ultimately inspired him to take up the discipline of Geology at the Royal School of Mines at Imperial College London.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Nevertheless, he always also had a strong inclination towards financial markets and thus simultaneously focused on developing his knowledge of that area throughout his degree as well. After spending some time with the mergers and acquisitions division of an investment bank, Ernest knew he would want a career which had those aspects but also something more.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Being continuously curious with his surroundings, Ernest decided to refine his knowledge and skill sets whilst diving into the world of (re)insurance in 2014. Quickly into his career, Ernest was very impressed by the amount of potential and capabilities the industry can offer, and developed a passion to set his aspirations on that path.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In a world where we are constantly improving, Ernest sees insurance for the masses not only as major change for the future but a sustainable step towards providing more value, organically, to our society.Excited to embark on this exhilarating journey, Ernest continues to learn and contribute (re)insurance perspectives into the evolution and growth of ARTS. </p>
